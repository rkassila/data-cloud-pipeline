# Cloud Data Pipeline with Dataflow & Terraform

An **automated** data pipeline built on **Google Dataflow** for processing, **Terraform** for infrastructure-as-code, and **Hugging Face** for data sourcing. This project will showcase how to ingest, transform, and deploy data workflows efficiently in the cloud.

## Key Features
- **Dataflow**: Real-time or batch data processing.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure provisioning and management.

Ideal for **data engineers** and **ML practitioners** looking to build end-to-end cloud-native pipelines.
